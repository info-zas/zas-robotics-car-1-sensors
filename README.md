## About This Repository
This folder contains the **Foundation Projects** for the  
**ZAS Robotics Navigational Robot Car-1 – Sensors Edition**.

Car-1 is an entry-level autonomous robot designed to teach:

- Sensor-based navigation  
- Obstacle avoidance  
- Line following & edge detection  
- Wall following  
- Left–right scanning with servo + ultrasonic  
- Basic robotics decision-making  
- Embedded motor control using TB6612  

## What You Learn
- How ultrasonic and IR sensors work  
- How a robot perceives the environment  
- How to combine multiple sensors for decisions  
- How an Arduino reads sensors and drives motors  
- How to build simple autonomous navigation logic  

## Ideal For
- Schools & STEM programs  
- Engineering colleges  
- Robotics & AI labs  
- Innovation hubs & Maker spaces  
- Robotics clubs / competitions  
- Self-learning students  

Car-1 is simple enough for beginners but powerful enough for advanced experiments in real autonomous robotics.
